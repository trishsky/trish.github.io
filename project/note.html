            of entertainment and information retrieval. It also satisfies needs for company and belonging for the viewers. Moreover, the real-time commenting can also be used to automatically detect key tags at a particular time points of the video.</p>

        <p>Despite having a less significant share of video hosting website market in China, Bilibili.com is chosen to be the source of Danmaku because it is has a very active atmosphere of the real-time video overlaying commenting.</p>
